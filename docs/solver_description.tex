\begin{abstract}
We describe DSHunter, our submission to the exact Dominating Set track of PACE 2025. DSHunter computes the minimium dominating set of a graph, by preprocessing the graph
into a smaller kernel of an extended Annotated Dominating Set problem instance. 
Kernelized instance is then solved by either a Vertex Cover solver, dynamic programming on a tree decomposition or a Branch\&Reduce algorithm depending on the instances structural properties.
\end{abstract}

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

DSHunter is an exact solver for finding a minimum dominating set of a graph.  DSHunter was developed for the 9th Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments challenge (PACE 2025).
The core idea behind the solver is first preprocessing the given instance into a generalized Annotated Dominating Set (ADS) problem instance.
In some cases the kernel yields an instance that is equivalent to Vertex Cover, and in those cases the solver calls an external Vertex Cover Solver \textcolor{red}{[REFERENCE]}.
In other cases where the kernel admits small treewidth the solver finds the minimum dominating set directly by dynamic programming on a tree decomposition.
The tree decomposition is found using a heuristic tree decomposition generator  FlowCutter \textcolor{red}{[REFERENCE]} from PACE 2017.
In all other cases the solver resorts to a Branch\&Reduce algorithm.


\section{Notation}

Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. The graph $G[X]$ is the induced subgraph of $G$ with vertex set $X$.
The set $N(v)$ denotes the open neighborhood of a vertex $v$ and $N[v] = N(v) \cup \{u\}$ the closed neighborhood of a vertex $v$.
The set $N[X] = \bigcup_{v \in X} N[v]$ denotes the closed neighborhood of a vertex set $X$.
The set $N(X) = N[X] \setminus X$ denotes the open neighborhood of a vertex set $X$.

An Annotated Dominating Set problem instance $I$ is tuple $(G, d, m, f, S)$, where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $d: V(G) \to \{\texttt{true}, \texttt{false}\}$, we say that a vertex $v$ is dominated iff $d(v) = \texttt{true}$, such vertices do not need to be dominated by the solution set.
    \item $m: V(G) \to \{\texttt{true}, \texttt{false}\}$, we say that a vertex $v$ is disregarded iff $m(v) = \texttt{true}$, such vertices cannot belong to the solution set.
    \item $f: E(G) \to \{\texttt{true}, \texttt{false}\}$, we say that an edge $e$ is forced iff $f(v) = \texttt{true}$, at least one endpoint of such an edge must belong to the solution set.
    \item $S$ is a set containing a partial solution containing the vertices of the original Dominating Set problem instance that are already known to belong to the optimal solution set.
    Such vertices are not present in $G$, i.e. $S \cap G(V) = \emptyset$.
\end{itemize}

By saying we force an edge $e$ we mean setting $f(e) = \texttt{true}$.

By saying we take a vertex $v$ we mean setting $d(u) = \texttt{true}$ for all $u \in N[v]$, then removing $v$ from $G$, and adding $v$ to $S$.

By $C(v)$ we denote the set $\{u \in N[v] \mid d(v) = \texttt{false}\}$ or $C(v) = \emptyset$ in the case when $v$ is disregarded, i.e. the set of undominated vertices vertex $v$ can dominate (cover). We call those vertices dominatees of $v$.

By $D(v)$ we denote the set $\{u \in N[v] \mid m(v) = \texttt{false}\}$ or $D(v) = \emptyset$ in the case when $v$ is dominated, i.e. the set of vertices that can dominate $v$. We call those vertices dominators of $v$.

By $N_{exit}(X)$ we denote the set $\{w \in N(X) \mid N(w) \setminus N[X] \neq \emptyset \vee \exists_{(v, w) \in G[N(X)]} f((v, w)) = \texttt{true}\}$.

By $N_{guard}(X)$ we denote the set $\{ w \in N(X) \setminus N_{exit}(X)\mid N(w) \cap N_{exit}(X) \neq \emptyset\}$.

By $N_{prison}(X)$ we denote the set $N[X] \setminus (N_{exit}(X) \cup N_{guard}(X))$.


Note that a Dominating Set problem instance $G$ can be expressed as an Annotated Dominating Set instance $I = (G, d, m, f, \emptyset)$, where $d$, $m$ and $f$ return \texttt{false} for all arguments.

\section{Presolving}
The solver starts by applying several reduction rules in a loop in the following order until all fail to apply. If a reduction rule succeeds, the loop starts from the beginning.
\subsection{Removal of vertices seeing both ends of a forced edge}
If there exists a vertex $v$ such that there exists a forced edge $(v, w) \in N(v)$, set $d(v) = \texttt{true}$ as it is guaranteed to be dominated by either $v$ or $w$, since one of them must belong to the optimal solution set.
This rule is an exception since it is not a part of the loop, but is applied the moment an edge is being forced, e.g. $f(e)$ changes from \texttt{false} to \texttt{true}.

\subsection{ForceEdgeRule}
If there exists an undominated vertex $u$ of degree 2 with neighbors $v$ and $w$, such that $v$ or $w$ is not disregarded:
\begin{itemize}
    \item if $(v, w) \in E(G)$ and $f((u, v)) = f((u, w)) = \texttt{false}$ then remove $u$ from $G$ and force edge $(v, w)$.
    \item if $(v, w) \in E(G)$ and exactly one of the edges $(u, v)$, $(u, w)$ is forced and its non-$u$ endpoint is not disregarded, take this endpoint into $S$.
    \item if $(v, w) \notin E(G)$ and both $v$ and $w$ are dominated, remove $u$ from $G$ from add an edge $(v, w)$ to $G$ and force it.
\end{itemize}

It is easy to verify that this reduction is correct.

\subsection{Disregard rule}
If there exists $(u, v) \in E(G)$ such that $m(v) = \texttt{false}$, $m(u) = \texttt{false}$, $C(v) \subseteq C(u)$ and there is no forced edge $(u, w) \in E(G)$ s.t $v \neq w$
then disregard vertex $u$, since in an optimal solution we can always replace it with vertex $v$.

\subsection{Remove Disregarded Rule}

\subsection{Single Dominator Rule}

\subsection{Same Dominators Rule}

\subsection{Alber rules}

We have extended the rules described by Alber \textcolor{red}{[REFERENCE ALBER]} to apply to the ADS problem by careful analysis how
they should handle disregarded vertices and forced edges. We did that for \emph{Simple Rules 1, 2, 3 and 4}, as well as for \emph{Main rules 1 and 2} from the referenced work.
\subsubsection{Simple Rule 1}
If there exists an unforced edge that both its endpoints are either dominated or disregarded, remove it from the graph.

If there exists $(u, v) \in E(G)$ s.t. $u$ is not disregarded and $v$ is not, take vertex $u$ into the solution set.


\subsubsection{Simple Rule 2}
If there exists an isolated dominated vertex $v$, remove it from the graph.

This rule was also meant apply to dominated vertices of degree 1, however due to an oversight we only apply it to isolated edges, for which it is optimal to take just one of the endpoints.

\subsubsection{Simple Rule 3}
If there exists a dominated vertex $v$ of degree 2 with undominated neighbors $u_1$ and $u_2$, s.t. $(u_1, u_2) \in E(G)$ or $u_1$ and $u_2$ share a common, non-disregarded neighbor then:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the edge $(v, u_1)$ is forced and the edge $(v, u_2)$ is not, take $u_1$.
    % \item If the edge $(v, u_2)$ is forced and the edge $(v, u_1)$ is not, take $u_2$.
    \item If both of the edges $(v, u_1)$, $(v, u_2)$ are unforced, remove $v$ from $G$.
\end{itemize}

Note that it is never the case that $(u_1, u_2) \in E(G)$ and both $u_1$ and $u_2$ are disregarded as Simple Rule 1 is applied before Simple Rule 3.

\subsubsection{Simple Rule 4}
If there exists a dominated vertex $v$ of degree 3 with undominated neighbors $u_1$, $u_2$ and $u_3$ s.t. $(u_1, u_2), (u_1, u_3) \in E(G)$ then
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the vertex $u_1$ is not disregarded and the edges $(v, u_2)$, $(v, u_3)$ are unforced, remove $v$ from $G$, also if the edge $(v, u_1)$ was forced take $u_1$.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Main Rule 1}
If there exists a non-disregarded vertex $u$ such that $N_{prison}(\{u\}) \neq \emptyset$ then take $u$, and remove $N_{prison}(\{u\})$ and $N_{guard}{(\{u\})}$ from G.

\subsubsection{Main Rule 2}


The rest of the rules reduce the size of the graph in cases where the structure of a neighborhood of a single vertex or a pair of them exposes some optimal partial solutions.
